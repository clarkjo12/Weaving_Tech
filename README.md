What is it about eating food out of a truck? I love it. You love it. They are taking over the country one hipster city at a time. I mean, nowadays you dont even need to ride you fixed gear bike there to get the newest jamacian-fusion tater tots. More importantly, you dont need to hear about it from mustache Larry down at the local bier garden. No. Now you have Where's My Food App!? A simple all-in-one app to track your favorite food trucks, find new ones nearby, and keep tabs on their coming's and going's as they cruise around town serving up their tasty treats.

## Tech behind the App

If you arent too keen on the nitty gritty, just know WFMA runs on magic and positive notes of encouragement from your mom. 

Really though, WFMA relies on a React framework, with an express.js and mongoDB backend. A bunch of other packages were used to help lighten the load, such as passport and bcrypt for encryption and storage, socket.io for realtime app communication, and leaflet for open source mapping.

## How do I use this thing?

As a user, or eater, you can log in locally, with a google account, or with a facebook account. Log in is not required to access the map, but it will unlock extra features such as favoriting trucks and more.

Once logged in you will be taken to a map page where any active food trucks in your local area will be visible.

All active trucks are dynamic. By clicking on a truck, a modal will pop out allowing users to favorite a truck, get directions, or access some additional information provided by the truck itself.

Truck operators will also have a simple page to update current menu information, deals, times and future locations, as well as activate or deactivate their truck on the map.

## What's next for WMFA!?

As previously mentioned, WMFA!? was originally a React.js project. While it does scale to mobile just fine, it lacks that true pocket functionality. The next stages include porting to react native, which are currently underway! End goal is to get the greenlight for both google play and the app store.

### About the Team

WMFA!? is the long-time brain child of Jon, an entrepreneur and former food truck operator, who decided to give the UNC Coding Bootcamp a shot. WMFA!? came to be as the final project for the course. The team includes:

* Jon Clark: Initial idea man, UX design

* Hilary Mallar: Team mom / dev wrangler, full backend framework and general whiz

* Brendan Cannell: The crazy guy that thought it would be fun to learn native and port this whole thing

* Beth Wehner: The quiet map queen, both Google Maps and Leaflet.js

* Tim Albrecht: Specialty react components, group rubber duck debugger, and a sweet readme

Even as our course together comes to a close, we look forward to continuing development on this project. It's amazing what a few focused individuals can accomplish in a short amount of time, and we look forward to sharing our new passion with the masses... 

... and tacos. That's the real reason we made this.
